            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TRue it is, that my ſiſter and my ſelfe (obliged thereunto by the Bonds of common nature, as well as thoſe of the ſtricteſt affection that may become ſo near a relation) have exhibited to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of State for juſtice againſt the Murtherers of our dear Brother, our Petition in forme following.</p>
            <div type="letter">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:166785:2"/>
               <head>To the Right Honourable, the Councell of State</head>
               <head type="sub">The Humble Petition of <hi>Elizabeth Worſopp,</hi> and <hi>Frances Clarke,</hi> the diſconſolate Siſters of <hi>Harcourt Greenway,</hi> late of <hi>Leckhamſteed,</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> Eſquire, deceaſed.</head>
               <opener>Sheweth:</opener>
               <p>THAT on Tueſday the <hi>22.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> the Portugall Ambaſſadours Brother, and divers others his Servants with Swords and Piſtols came upon the New-Exchange, in a moſt inſolent and riotous manner, where their ſaid Brother civilly, and peaceably then being, was moſt barbarouſly (no provocation given them by him) ſet on by the ſaid Portuguez, and piſtoll'd in the head: of which wound (the very braine flying out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at) within twelve houres after, in extreame anguiſh and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he moſt miſerably dyed.</p>
               <p>That he was their only Brother, and by whoſe untimely death (as not exceeding the age of <hi>24</hi> years, and unmarried, their whole Name and Family is become utterly extinct, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved not onely of the preſent comforts of a deare Brother, but faire hopes alſo of much future emolument, in the Right and Title which was in him for the recovery of his Fathers Eſtate, neare <hi>1000</hi> l. <hi>per annum</hi> aliened from him.</p>

               <p>NOw whereas by a late Printed paper, ſubſcribed by the name of <hi>Pantaleon Sa,</hi> the world is in ſome danger to bee impoſed on to an erroneous faith, that the perſons againſt whom we have petition'd have been too violently proſecuted by us, and (though in order to a legall triall) too rigorouſly treated by the Juſticiaries of our Common-wealth, I conceived it moſt imported mee (my ſiſters ſickneſſe indiſpoſing her otherwiſe) then by aſſent to joyne with mee in ſome Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on the ſaid paper, to vindicate to both Nations, Engliſh and Portuguez, at leaſt thoſe who underſtand Engliſh, the onely tongue I know to expreſſe my ſelf in, as well the honour as the legality of the proceedings; and withall, that by thoſe the Engliſh Nobility, and the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> whom this paper endeavours to Cajole into ſuch a commiſeration of his Perſon, and opinion of his innocency, that the horrid and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous murther of an Engliſh Gentleman, in every thing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166785:3"/>(as to the Murtherers) a moſt innocent perſon, and one who (let mee without envy ſince hee is dead, affirme) had known valour and bravery enough to have rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him not only ſerviceable, but an honour to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might be forgotten, and out of a foeminine, and in matters of bloud, unmanlike, and unchriſtian pitty a proſecution of Juſtice againſt the Offenders might be remitted.</p>
               <p>To the Relation of the firſt dayes paſſages I ſhall ſay little, nothing being more in my abhorrency then inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and eſpecially to ſtrangers, and yet unleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port bee very falſe, if any of our Engliſh Gentlemen ſhewed themſelves ill diſciplined in the Ethicks, they found the Portuguez but uncivill Tutors: For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe for a word (perhaps too provoked) a blow, yea a ſtab be (what I have more noble thoughts of them then to believe) Portugall Juſtice, and foure afterwards upon one Portugall fortitude, they themſelves muſt needs conclude Morality to have been as fouly tranſgreſt by ſome of their owne Nation.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing an affront beyond a Gentlemans ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and a complaint to that Power under whoſe protection hee was, beneath his honour, was there no nobler way of vindication then by a Riot? Street combates, and popular engagements were never held to have much of the Cavalier in them: But <hi>Don Pantaleon</hi> (whom were not his hands red with my Brothers bloud) I ſhould equally honour with his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166785:3"/>height of birth and minde profeſſeth that hee feared none, nor ſuſpected in the leaſt that any would aſſault him when they ſaw him unarmed: I ſhall not queſtion how unarmed he came on the Exchange, though (if report be true) hee had defenſive Armes enough for more then one perſon; but if the evidence which hath been given in this buſineſſe be true, it will ſufficiently appeare, if he had no ſword himſelfe, his ſervant who was at his heeles had two; and that when the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change was cleared (I cannot but believe more through the civility then feare in the Engliſh that were on the place, or valour of the Portuguez) he was one of thoſe who when my dear Brother lay wallowing in his bloud and braines, in a triumphing, and braving manner, both of jeſture and language, went ſlaſhing their ſwords againſt the ſtones.</p>
               <p>But who that will not againſt Juſtice it ſelfe be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, can beleeve that the Exchange mens ſhutting up their ſhops began this ſecond unhappy broyle? eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he conſider indeed the warlike preparations to it: doth Gunpowder and Granadoes, and I know not what, uſe to be carried about for defence? Indeed I am none of thoſe that think there was a deſign of beſiege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or blowing up the Exchange, but that their Deſign was revenge, I not only believe, but am very confident the proofe of their preparations all that day of all ſorts of Armes, and invitation of others to their aſſiſtance, beſides their own Family will make apparent enough.</p>
               <p>Or who that were not ſo nearely concerned could chuſe but ſmile at the vanity of that inſinuation that it might bee an Engliſh man as well as a Portugall, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166785:4"/>ſhot that diſaſtrous Piſtoll, and that it was ſhot from the aſcent of the lower walk to the higher, but I ſhal ſay little of this at the preſent; I hope that their juſt triall will not be long deferred, when I doubt not but it will be enough proved, that the bold murderer was a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, that hee did that cruell and baſe action upon an innocent and unprovided perſon, not by accident but by aime and deſigne, directing his Piſtoll to his head which fell at the feete of the bloudy murtherer.</p>
               <p>But ſurely to have ceaſed that needleſſe terrour it had been more proper to have fairely retreated, or at leaſt repelled the irruption of his ſervants then to have head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to the driving off of the Engliſh on the place, and to have cleared himſelfe of the murther of my Brother: to have expreſt a ſorrow for it, if not a care for him rather than a triumph: but his ſorrow ſince now I beleeve he may have reaſon for it, I beleeve and blame him not, in this condition which I can hartily even for him as a Gentleman and a Chriſtian grieve, for to tell the faireſt tale he can for himſelf, but if in criminall acts the delinquents Rhetoricall envying againſt the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſſe of them may argue the improbability of his commitment of them, I would wonder to heare in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166785:4"/>what the rights of my moſt unfortunate deare Brother extort from me. For I can, if my griefs may receive an addition, adde to them a harty ſorrow for every unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate perſon (that nevertheleſſe I cannot but hope) muſt ſuffer for this bloudy murther: I can heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile that a Gentleman of ſo noble and illuſtrious an extraction, ſhould amongſt ſtrangers, from whom his owne King (I may I thinke ſay by him) required amity and friendſhip, premeditatedly run himſelfe into ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous and ruinous an action, though I do profeſſe to all the world that neither my ſiſter or my ſelfe who are the only neerly concerned perſons do know that he hath afforded us a pitty or condolement in our unſpeakable griefes, nor oblieged us to any ſuch commiſeration by a civill meſſage that he was ſorry for our miſfortunes, notwithſtanding his flouriſh of comfort and ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the end of his narration; but the comfort and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction I begge in the behalfe of myſelfe and ſiſter is juſtice, which I humbly implore from God, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and all who may give it us, or aſſiſt us in the procuring of it, and which I doubt not but the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld equity of our Laws, and adhering of our Juſticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to them will give us.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore ſay nothing more to thoſe inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his kindneſſes or civilities to the Engliſh Gentry, ſince I cannot but believe every one of them will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my Brothers unhappy fate might have beene his owne.</p>
